            <h1>Intro to Joshua</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Joshua Bohn, I live in and commute from Oshkosh, and this is my second year now at Fox Valley Tech. I am in the software development program because I aspire to be a game developer, though I have enjoyed building html websites and I enjoyed said class. In my free time I like to play games but also write as well! For a small fun fact about myself, I like listening to music in order to motivate myself to work.</p>
